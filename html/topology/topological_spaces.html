                                We will verify it's a topology from the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-topology-on-a-set">definition</span>

                                `O/` is in `G_{cc B}` because it vacuously satisfies the condition. `X` is in `G_{cc B}` since given any point `x in X`, we have a `B in cc B` such that `x in B sube X` by the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-set">definition of a basis</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now suppose we have an arbitrary union of elements from `G_{cc B}`, say `S sube G_{cc B}, M = bigcup_{U in S} U`. We need to verify that `M in G_{cc B}`, so let `x in M`, therefore `x in bar U` for some `bar U in S` and since `bar U` was assumed to be in `G_{cc B}` we know that there is some `B in cc B` such that `x in B sube bar U` but also `bar U sube M` since `M` includes `bar U` in the union so then `x in B sube M` meaning by <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-collection-generated-by-a-basis"> the definition</span> that `M in G_{cc B}`
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now if we are given a finite intersection of elements from `G_{cc B}` we will prove by induction that it is also an element of `G_{cc B}`
                                <ul>
                                    <li>base case</li>
                                    <p>
                                        if `n = 1` then the union of one element from `G_{cc B}` (namely just itself) is also an element of `G_{cc B}` trivially.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before moving to the inductive step, notice that it also holds for `n = 2`, because given `U_1, U_2 in G_{cc B}`, we can see that for any `x in U_1 nn U_2`, we know that we have a basis elements `B_1, B_2 in cc B` such that `x in B_1 sube U_1` and `x in B_2 sube U_2` and thus `x` also belongs to the intersection of `B_1` and `B_2`, so by the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-set">definition of a basis</span>, we get a `B_3 sube B_1 nn B_2` that contains `x` since `B_1 nn B_2 sube U_1 nn U_2`, we have `x in B_3 sube U_1 nn U_2`, which means that `U_1 nn U_2 in G_{cc B}`
                                    </p>
                                    <li>inductive step</li>
                                    <p>
                                        Let `k in NN_1` and assume that the intersection of `k` elements from `G_{cc B}` is also in `G_{cc B}` now we'll show it's true for `k + 1`. So consider the intersection `U_1 nn ... nn U_(k+1)`, then we can re-write it as `(U_1 nn ... nn U_k) nn U_(k+1)` so by our inductive hypothesis `(U_1 nn ... nn U_k) in G_{cc B}` and therefore this `k+1` union is a union of two elements already in `G_{cc B}` so by our `n = 2` argument `U_1 nn ... nn U_{k+1} in G_{cc B}`, as needed.
                                    </p>

                                We'll first show that `cc C` is a basis, so let `x in X`, but `X` is open and so we can use `X` as the element of `cc C` satisfying `x in X sube X`.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now let `C_1, C_2` be elements of `cc C` and now consider `C_1 nn C_2`, since it's a finite intersection, then we know it's also open in `X` from the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-topology-on-a-set">definition of a topology</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since `C_1 nn C_2` is open, let `x in C_1 nn C_2`, then by the definition of `cc C`, there is some `C in cc C` such that `x in C sube C_1 nn C_2`, so we can take `B_3 = C` in the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-set">definition of basis</span>, to see that the second condition is satisfied, and thus we know that `cc C` is a basis
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now we want to show that `cc T_{cc C} = cc T`. So suppose `U in cc T_{cc C}`, <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#theorem-topology-generated-by-a-basis-consists-of-unions">then it can be written as a union as elements from `cc C`</span>, but since `cc C` was defined to consist of open sets of `X`, then this union is also open with respect to `X` by the definition of a topology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now suppose that `U in cc T` and consider some `x in U` then by the definition of `cc C`, there is some `C in cc C` such that `x in C sube U`, <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-topology-generated-by-a-basis">looking back at the definition for a topology generated by a basis</span>, we can see this means `U in cc T_{cc C}`, as needed.
