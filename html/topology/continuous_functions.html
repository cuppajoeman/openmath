        <p>Now if \( f \) is constant, then suppose \( f \left( x \right) = c \) for any \( x \in X \) therefore if we're given an open \( V \) in \( Y \) then if \( c \in V \) then \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) = X \) and if not then \( f ^ { -1 }\left( V \right) = \emptyset \), in either case the inverse image is open. On the other hand if \( f \) is not constant, we shall prove \( f \) is finite to one, then still supposing that \( V \) was open in \( Y \) then that means that \( Y \setminus V \) is finite or \( V = \emptyset \) (But in that case \( f ^ { -1 } \left( \emptyset \right) = \emptyset \) which is open in \( X \)), so supposing that that difference was finite, then we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( Y \setminus V \right) = \bigcup _ { p \in Y \setminus V } f ^ { -1 } \left( p \right) \) which is a finite union of finite sets and thus finite, but we also know that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( Y \setminus V \right) = X \setminus f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) therefore \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) is open in \( X \) which is exactly what we wanted to prove.</p>

        Suppose that \( f \) is a bijection, then \( f \) is a <a class="knowledge-link" href="/topology/continuous_functions.html#definition-homeomorphism">homeomorphism</a> iff the following is true: \( f \left( U \right) \) is open in \( Y \) iff \( U \) is open in \( X \)
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>Suppose that \( f \) is a homeomorphism, and that \( U \) is a subset of \( X \), assume \( f \left( U \right) \) is open in \( Y \) , we'll prove that \( U \) is open in \( X \), since \( f \) is continuous, then we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( f \left( U \right) \right) \) is an open set of \( X \), since \( f \) is a bijection, this means it's injective and thus \( f ^ { -1 } \left( f \left( U \right) \right) = U \) as needed.</p>
        <p>Now suppose that \( U \) is open in \( X \), since we know that \( f ^ { -1 } \) is continuous this means that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), <a class="knowledge-link" href="/fundamentals/functions.html#exercise-inverse-image-of-the-inverse-function-is-the-image">we've shown</a> that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) = f \left( U \right) \), thus, we've just shown that \( f \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), this concludes</p>
        <p>At this point we've proven the main rightward implication. The other direction is quite a lot easier. We have to show that both \( f \) and \( f ^ { -1 } \) are continuous.</p>
        <p>Suppose that \( V \) is an open set of \( Y \), we want to show that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) is an open set of \( X \), which is true iff \( f \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), since \( f \) is surjective, then \( f \left( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \right) = V \) making it an open set of \( Y \), which shows that \( f ^ { -1 } \left( V \right) \) is an open set of \( X \)</p>
        <p>Now suppose that \( U \) is an open set of \( X \) , our goal will be to show that \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) \) is an open set of \( Y \), as seen previously \( \left( f ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \left( U \right) = f \left( U \right) \), and since \( U \) was open in \( X \), by our assmption we know that \( f \left( U \right) \) is open in \( Y \), this concludes the proof.</p>
