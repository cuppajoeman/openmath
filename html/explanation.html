<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The purpose of this page is to help users get more comfortable with how openmath works before, as an intermediary between using the site and working with the source code.</p>
<p>openmath is a static html site that uses vanilla js and css, we use a few external libraries for graphics and formatting mathematical content.</p>
<p>Some of the strong pull factors for openmath are that it's incredibly simple, it is a static site that contains mathematical content, while at the same time having the strength of a database by being able to refer to other content located in other files without being a dynamic site.</p>
<p>We manage to do this by lazily using fetch requests in unison with <code>document.getElementById</code> calls, which indirectly induces a type of filesystem database.</p>
<p>For example suppose that we have a knowledge link on <code>A.html</code> pointing to some knowledge located at <code>B.html#definition-somedef</code>, then we fetch the html from <code>B.html</code>, parse it into a document, then use <code>document.getElementById("definition-somedef")</code> on that document, and inject the resulting element back into <code>A.html</code> and then re-run MathJax on that element.</p>
<p>We keep the cost of this operation low, by keeping our knowledge files small, which is also nice for the user as they're not overwhelmed with information</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<p>let's look at the basic form of a definition, for example division</p>
<pre><code>
&amp;ltdiv class="definition" id="definition-divides"&gt;
        &amp;ltdiv class="title"&amp;gtdivides&lt;/div&gt;
        &amp;ltdiv class="content"&gt;
                an integer \( n \) is divisible by a non-zero integer \( m \) if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n = k \cdot m \). If this is all true we write \( m | n \).
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                                </code></pre>
<p>Breaking it down, we can see that there is a title, the content, mathematical equations written in latex (and parsed by MathJax) and the outer div is given a special id.</p>
<p>Each of the classes used here are defined in <code>/styles/style.css</code> and gives it styling (similar to beamer)</p>
<p>Now let's look at a more complicated example</p>
<pre><code>
&amp;ltdiv class="proposition" id="proposition-1-divides-everything"&gt;
        &amp;ltdiv class="title"&amp;gt1 divides everything&lt;/div&gt;
        &amp;ltdiv class="content"&gt;
                Suppose that \( j \in \mathbb{Z} \), then \( 1 | j \)
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &amp;ltdiv class="proof"&gt;
                In the &amp;ltspan class="knowledge-link" data-href="/number_theory/number_theory.html#definition-divides"&amp;gtdefinition of divides&lt;/span&gt;
                take \( k = j \), then we can see that \( j = j \cdot 1 \) thus we can say that \( 1 | j \)
&lt;/div&gt;
                                </code></pre>
<p>As you can see we've packaged both the statement and the proof into a div with it's own id. In the proof, we have something new: the knowledge link.</p>
<p>A knowledge link is what allows for recursive learning, and is used when we are referencing a piece of information such as a definition, or proved statement, so that the reader knows how we deduce that the next statement is true via this knowledge.</p>
<p>Notice that the form of the <code>href</code> is an absolute path and the id of the element delimited with a # symbol. This is actually a regular URL, nothing fancy here.</p>
<p>The most relevant entry point will be, to take a look at <code>/js/script.js</code> which contains all the main logic, specificially let's take a look at the function <code>setUpKnowledgeLink</code>. Feel free to open this code in your editor of choice.</p>
<p>In this function the main steps are to use the <code>href</code> to fetch the relevant section of html from the respective webpage, and paste it after the knowledge link when it is clicked.</p>
<p>From this point onward, you can explore the <code>preparePage</code> function which is main function call used on every page. Besides the css for a page that is all the code that runs.</p>
<h1>Templates</h1>
<p>in <code>preparePage</code> the header is loaded in programatically using a fetch call, see <code>setUpAndAddHeader</code>.</p>
