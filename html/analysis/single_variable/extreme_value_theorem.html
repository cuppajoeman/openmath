				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					Let `B = {p in [a, b]: f(x) text( is bounded on ) [a, p]}`, note that `a in B` since `f( [{:a,a:}] ) = {f(a)}` <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/analysis/single_variable/extreme_value_theorem.html#proposition-finite-sets-are-bounded">therefore</span> `f([{:a, b:}])` is bounded.
					<p>
						Suppose that `e in B` and `e gt a`, then `f` is bounded on `[a,e]` by the definition of `B`, meaning that for any `a lt m lt e`, `f` is bounded on `[a,m]` so `m in B`, this shows that `B` is an interval of the form `[a, x]` for `x in [a, b]`.
					</p>
					<p>
						`f` is continuous at `a`, then let `t in RR` be a throwaway value insofar as to obtain some `delta in RR^(gt 0)` so that for all `x in text(dom)(f) = [a, b]`, we have `abs(x - a) lt delta` implying `abs(f(x) - f(a)) lt t`. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This shows us that `f` is bounded on `[a, a + delta]` using our throwaway value of `t`, therefore `a + delta in B` and as mentioned in the second paragraph, we know `[a, a + delta] sube B`, this means that `B` has at least two values, so we can find another element `y in B` such that `a lt y`.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since `RR` has the least upper bound property then since `B` is bounded above by `b`, then we know that `s := text(sup)(B) in B`, from the existance of `y`, then by chaining inequalities we get `a lt s` (todo: define set builder notation) (anything amaller has a point greater def of sup)
