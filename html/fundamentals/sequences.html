				A sequence is a <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/functions.html#definition-function">function </span>is any function `f` such that `text(dom)(f) = NN_1`. With this in place, we can consider the `n`-th element by `f(n)`. Since we can think of the sequence as being enumerated, the notation `a_n` is employed for `f(n)` where `a` is usually any choice of lower case alphabet characters like `a, b, c, d, ...`. That said, we can notate the entire sequence by `(a_n)`
