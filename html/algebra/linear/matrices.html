                        A matrix is a rectangular array of objects arranged in rows and columns. We say the dimensions of a matrix are `m xx n` when it has `m` rows and `n` columns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually matrices are denoted by capital letters such as `A, B, M, N`, we can get the value at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column by writing `A_{i, j}` 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we were to write the matrix graphically we would introduce coefficients that represent each value inside the matrix like so

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If we want to talk about a certain row of `A` we can write `A_{i, -}` for a column of `A` we may write `A_{|, j}`. The `-` represents that we may vary the column variable horizontally, and the `|` denotes that the row variable may be varied vertically.

                            To show that the linear transformation is uniquely determined by these scalars, we will try to use the fact that elements in each vector space are already uniquely determined by their own constants and go from there.

                            Let `v_j` be one of the basis vectors for `V`, then consider `T(v_j) in W` since it's a vector in `W` it can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors in `W`, so that `T(v_j) = sum_{i = 1}^l a_i w_i`.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now given a generic `x in V` which is not necessarily a basis vector, we can represent it as follows `T(x) = T(sum_{j = 1} ^ k c_j v_j) = sum_{j = 1}^k c_j T(v_j)` recalling from our previosu paragraph, we can see that `sum_{j = 1}^k (c_j sum_{i = 1}^l a_i w_i) = sum_{j = 1}^k sum_{i = 1}^l c_j a_i w_i`.

                    <p>
                        Recall that we can extract the column of a matrix using the column extraction method discussed earlier

                    <p>
                        To be successful at that we need to generate a unit column matrix. We can do so by plugging in `v_k in cc V` into the above equation which yields: `T v_k = text(wav)(M_T text(wam)(v_k, cc V)) = text(wav)(M_T e_k) = text(wav)((M_T)_{|, k}) `

                    <p>
                        Thus `text(wam)(Tv_k) = (M_T)_{|, k}`, so the columns of `M_T` are `T v_k` written as a column matrices. Graphically we have
