				<div class="proof">

						Let \( t \) be the only element of \( T \), we claim this is the identity, which we can verify by checking \( t \star t = t \), because \( \star \) is constant, thus it is an <a class="knowledge-link" href="/algebra/groups/binary_operations_and_groups.html#definition-identity-element">identity element</a>.

				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					Suppose that \( a \star c = b \star c \), let \( c ^ { -1 }  \) be the inverse of \( c \) , then we have the following

					Where we've used associativity followed by the definition of inverse and then the identity element. The proof for right cancellation can be obtained by placing a mirror on the left of the above chain of equalities and reversing individual elements, so that if you see ɘ you interpret it as e.

					Let \( G \) be a group. Given a non-empty \( H \subseteq G \) if \( a b ^ { -1 } \in H \) for any \( a, b \in H \), then \( H \leqslant G \)
				</div>
				<div class="proof">
					<p>
						Since \( H \) is non-empty then there is some element \( h \in H \), thus we know that \( h h ^ { -1 } \in H \), since \( h \in H \), since \( H \subseteq G \), then we know that \( h \in G \), and therefore in \( G \) we have an inverse \( h ^ { -1 }  \) such that \( h h ^  { -1 } = e \), where \( e \in G \) but by assumption this is also an element of \( H \), thus \( e \in H \).
					</p>
					<p>
						So now we know that \( e \in H \), how can we be sure this is the identity in \( H \)? Perhaps it is not, but given any \( s \in H \), since \( H \subseteq G \), we know \( s \in G \) then using the fact that \( G \) is a group we see \( e \star s  = s \star e \), since \( e \) is also in \( H \) this confirms that it is \( H \)'s identity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we'll show that \( H \) has inverses, so let \( a \in H \),  at the same time we know we have \( e \in H \), thus \( e a ^ { -1 } \in H \) and thus \( a ^ { -1 }  \in H \) as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						At this point it may seem like we've verified all the requirements for \( H \) to be a group, but there's something a little subtle, when we were working with \( \star \) we know that it was composition law meaning that this operation is closed for elements in \( G \), so we also need to verify that \( \star \) is closed in \( H \), that is to say that \( \star \) is a composition law in \( H \), so let \( x, y \in H \), then from the previous paragraph we know that \( y ^ { -1 }  \) is a member of \( H \), thus \( x \left( y ^ { -1 }  \right) ^ { -1 } \in H \)
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				Notice that the equation stated above is special, firstly given two elements in \( a, b \in H \) it combines \( a  \) and \( b ^ { -1 }  \), the special thing here is the \( b ^ { -1 }  \), originally we don't know if this element is a member of \( H \) because in the proof we verify if indeed it is a group, and we don't know that inverses exists until we verify them, but we do know when it's combined with \( b ^ { -1 }  \) it produces an element of \( H \).
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that we need \( H \) to be non-empty otherwise the empty set would satisfy the above, and we know that the empty set is not a group. It also helps us bootstrap the proof.
