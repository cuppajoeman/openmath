                the brackets in the product \( x_{1} \star x_{2} \star \ldots \star x_{n} \) it always evaluates to the
                same value
            </div>
            <div class="proof">
                <p>
                    In order to prove this statement we have to prove that no matter the bracketing we get the same
                    value, but what exactly is this value? It must be the result of <i>some</i> bracketing so to make
                    our life easier let's select a left-most bracketing of the form
                    \[
                    \left( \left( x _ 1 \star x _ 2 \right) \star x _ 3 \star \cdots \right) \star x _ k
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore the statement we are trying to prove is equivalent to that of: for any \( k \in \mathbb{ N
                    } ^ { \ge 3 } \) given the syntactically incorrect
                    \[
                    x _ 1 \star x _ 2 \star \cdots \star x _ k
                    \]
                    then given any syntactically valid version (obtained by inserting brackets), the value of the
                    expression is equal to the value of the version where it is bracketed in the left-most manner. We'll
                    prove this by strong induction or induction, which we will determine as the proof continues.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    For the base case this holds true because of associativity. Now for the induction step assume it
                    holds true for \( k \in \mathbb{ N } ^ { \ge 3 } \) and lets show that it holds true for \( k + 1
                    \), suppose we have a product \( x _ 1 \star \cdots \star x _ { k + 1 } \) and then an arbitrary
                    bracketing of the product which is syntactically valid, it must have the form
                    \[
                    \left( e _ a \right) \star \left( e _ b \right)
                    \]
                    where \( a + b = k + 1 \) where without loss of generality \( a \ge 2 \) and \( b \ge 1 \), due to
                    this we also know that \( a, b \le k \)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we are (now) using strong induction then we know that the property holds true on \( e _ a, e _
                    b \) as they are arbitrarily bracketed expressions, each of which have the same value as their
                    left-most bracketed counterparts, and therefore since they have the same value, they can be
                    substituted so that
                    \[
                    \left( e _ a \right) \star \left( e _ b \right) = \left( \left( \left( x _ 1 \star x _ 2 \right)
                    \star \cdots \right) \star x _ a \right) \star \left( \left( \left( x _ { a + 1 } \star x _ { a + 2
                    } \right) \star \cdots \right) \star x _ { a + b } \right)
                    \]
                    at this point we've done some work, now if we can re-arrange this to be fully left-bracketed which
                    would prove the statement true, recall that one of the properties we haven't used yet is
                    associativity of \( \star \) . Closing our left eye, we can observe that:
                    \[
                    \left( e _ a \right) \star \left( e _ { b - 1 } \star x _ { a + b } \right) = \left( e _ a \star e _
                    { b - 1 } \right) \star x _ { a + b }
                    \]
                    Now \( \left( e _ a \star e _ { b - 1 } \right) \) is a arbitrarily bracketed expression of using \(
                    a + b - 1 \lt k + 1\) elements and so by our strong induction hypothesis we know that it's value is
                    equal to the leftmost bracketed version of itself, so we have
                    \[
                    \left( e _ a \star e _ { b - 1 } \right) \star x _ { a + b } = \left( \left( \left( x _ 1 \star x _
                    2 \right) \star \cdots\right) \star x _ { b - 1 } \right) \star x _ { a + b }
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chaining equalities, we've proven that \( \left( e _ a \right) \star \left( e _ b \right) = \left(
                    \left( \left( x _ 1 \star x _ 2 \right) \star \cdots\right) \star x _ { b - 1 } \right) \star x _ b
                    \), which is exactly what we wanted to show, therefore by induction this shows that the property
                    holds for every expression.

            because there are no elements as candidate for this position. At this point in time we know that in a group
            there is at least one element \( e \) with the above properties, we will now find out that there is exactly

            </div>
            <div class="proof">
                <p>
                    Since \( H \) is non-empty then there is some element \( h \in H \), thus we know that \( h h ^ { -1
                    } \in H \), since \( h \in H \), since \( H \subseteq G \), then we know that \( h \in G \), and
                    therefore in \( G \) we have an inverse \( h ^ { -1 } \) such that \( h h ^ { -1 } = e \), where \(
                    e \in G \) but by assumption this is also an element of \( H \), thus \( e \in H \).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now we know that \( e \in H \), how can we be sure this is the identity in \( H \)? Perhaps it is
                    not, but given any \( s \in H \), since \( H \subseteq G \), we know \( s \in G \) then using the
                    fact that \( G \) is a group we see \( e \star s = s \star e \), since \( e \) is also in \( H \)
                    this confirms that it is \( H \)'s identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we'll show that \( H \) has inverses, so let \( a \in H \), at the same time we know we have \(
                    e \in H \), thus \( e a ^ { -1 } \in H \) and thus \( a ^ { -1 } \in H \) as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point it may seem like we've verified all the requirements for \( H \) to be a group, but
                    there's something a little subtle, when we were working with \( \star \) we know that it was
                    composition law meaning that this operation is closed for elements in \( G \), so we also need to
                    verify that \( \star \) is closed in \( H \), that is to say that \( \star \) is a composition law
                    in \( H \), so let \( x, y \in H \), then from the previous paragraph we know that \( y ^ { -1 } \)
                    is a member of \( H \), thus \( x \left( y ^ { -1 } \right) ^ { -1 } \in H \)
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Notice that the equation stated above is special, firstly given two elements in \( a, b \in H \) it combines
            \( a \) and \( b ^ { -1 } \), the special thing here is the \( b ^ { -1 } \), originally we don't know if
            this element is a member of \( H \) because in the proof we verify if indeed it is a group, and we don't
            know that inverses exists until we verify them, but we do know when it's combined with \( b ^ { -1 } \) it
            produces an element of \( H \).
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that we need \( H \) to be non-empty otherwise the empty set would satisfy the above, and we know that
            the empty set is not a group. It also helps us bootstrap the proof.
