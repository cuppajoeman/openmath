                Firstly we know that \( \left( a \right) := R \otimes \left\{ a \right\}  \) and that \( R \otimes \left\{ a \right\}  \) is an ideal, clearly it contains \( a \) because \( a - 0 _ R  \) must be in it since it's an ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                \( \left( \left\{ a \right\}  \right)  \) is defined as \( \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\}  \) where \( \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\}  \) is the family of all ideals in \( R \) that contain \( \left\{ a \right\}  \). From this we can straight away see that \( \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\} \subseteq R \otimes \left\{ a \right\}    \) since \( R \otimes \left\{ a \right\} \in \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\}  \) and the intersection can only get smaller. Thus we've just shown that \( \left( \left\{ a \right\} \right) \subseteq \left( a \right)   \)
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll now prove that \( \left( a \right) \subseteq \left( \left\{ a \right\}  \right)  \), let \( x \in \left( a \right) := R \otimes \left\{ a \right\}  \) thus \( x = r \otimes a \) for some \( r \in R \), our goal is to show that \( r \otimes a \in \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\}  \) , that is we must show that \( r \otimes a \in I \) for any \( I \in \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\} \).
            </p>
            <p>
                Well if the above is true then \( I \) is an ideal that contains \( a \), therefore by the second property of an ideal we can see that \( r \otimes a \in I \), which is what we needed to show, so we can see that \( x \in \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ \left\{ a \right\} := \left( \left\{ a \right\}  \right)   \). Thus we conclude that \( \left( a \right) = \left( \left\{ a \right\}  \right)  \) as needed.

    	<div class="proof">
            <p>
                Note \( I \) is an ideal that contains \( A \), this is because we can systematically set a specific \( r _ i = 1 \) and for each \( i \neq j \) have \( r _ j = 0 \) which turns the sum into \( a _ i \) , then we know that \( \left( A  \right) \subseteq I \), this is because \( \left( A \right)  \) is the smallest ideal containing \( A \)
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we'll prove that \( I \subseteq \left( A  \right)  \) let \( s = \sum _ { i = 1 }  ^ n r _ i a _ i \in I \), to do so we recognize that \( \left( A  \right) := \bigcap \mathcal{ I } _ A  \) so that we must show that \( s \in I \) for every \( I \in \mathcal{ I } _ A \).
            </p>
            <p>
                This \( \left( A \right)  \) is an ideal that contains \( A \) therefore note that \( r _ i a _ i \) is part of \( \left( A \right)  \), therefore we can see that each \( a _ i r _ i \in \left( A \right)  \),
            </p>
            <p>
                Since \( \left( A \right)  \) is an ideal then we know it's closed under finite addition meaning that \( \sum _ { i = 1 }  ^ n x _ i \in \left( A \right)  \) for any \( x _ i \in \left( A \right)  \), since we know each \( a _ i r _ i \in \left( A \right) \) then by setting \( x _ i = a _ i r _ i  \) we have shown that \( \sum _ { i = 1 }  ^ n a _ i r _ i \in \left( A \right)   \) as needed and thus \( I = \left( A \right)  \)

We can also see by the first property that each since each of the summands are elements of \( I \) so will be their finite summation. Thus \( \sum _ { i = 1 }  ^ n r _ i a _ i b _ i \in I \).

                We start by showing that \( R \) is a crone, first recall that by first year calculus we know that the product and sum of two continous functions on a certain domain is still continuous on that domain, additionally we have defined \( \left( f + g \right)  \left( x \right) = f \left( x \right) + g \left(x \right)   \) but addition and multiplication commute in \( \mathbb{ R }  \) so it's easy to prove that \( f + g = g + f \) and \( f \cdot g = g \cdot f \) moreover we can also get associativity this way, all these facts together show that \( R \) is closed with respect to \( +, \cdot  \) and \( \cdot, +  \) are both associative and commutative, we also have inverses with respect to \( + \) this is because for any function \( f \), the function, \( - f  \) which is defined as \( - f \left( x \right) = \left( -1 \right) f \left( x \right)    \) has the property that \( f + \left( - f \right) = 0   \) where on the right we have the constant function that maps everything to zero (which is the additive inverse). So it is a crone.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need to prove that \( I _ c \) is an ideal, therefore suppose that \( f, g \in I _ c \), we want to show that \( f - g \in I _ c \), but we can see that \( \left( f - g \right) \left( c \right) := f \left( c \right) - g \left( c  \right) = 0  \), so we know that \( f - g \in I _ c \). Now let \( h : \left[ 0, 1 \right] \to \mathbb{ R }  \) be any continuous function, and suppose that \( k \in I _ c \) then \( \left( h \cdot k \right) \left( c \right) := h \left( c \right) \cdot k \left( c \right) =  h  \left( c \right) \cdot 0 = 0 \), therefore \( h \cdot c  \in I _ c \) as needed, so that \( I _ c \) is an ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see that \( I _ { c _ 1 } \cup I _ { c _ 2 }  \) is not an ideal, this is because they may vanish at different places, consider the following counter example: \( f, g \in I _ { c _ 1 } \cup I _ { c _ 2 }  \) then perhaps \( f \left( c _ 1  \right) = 0  \) but \( f \left( c _ 2 \right) = 1  \) and \( g \left( c _ 1 \right) = 1 \) and \( g \left( c _ 2 \right) = 0 \), then if we consider \( \left( f - g \right) \left( c _ 1 \right) := f \left( c _ 1 \right) - g \left( c _ 1 \right) = 0 + 1 \neq 0   \) and then also \( \left( g - f \right) \left( c _ 1 \right) := g \left( c _ 1 \right) - f \left( c _ 1 \right) = 1 + 0 \neq 0   \) so therefore \( f - g \notin I _ { c _ 1 } \cup I _ { c _ 2 } \) so it cannot be an ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We should have that \( I _ { c _ 1 } \cap I _ { c _ 2 }   \) is an ideal, this is because now an element would have two vanishing points and things would fallout like in our original verification that \( I _ c \) was an ideal, well anyway suppose that \( f, g \in I _ { c _ 1 } \cap I _ { c _ 2 }  \) now note that \( f - g \left( c _ 1 \right) = 0 = f - g \left( c _ 2 \right) \) because they both vanish at these points so \( f - g \in I _ { c _ 1 } \cap I _ { c _ 2 } \). Now suppose that \( h \in R \) and \( k \in I _ { c _ 1 } \cap I _ { c _ 2 }  \) then \( h k \left( c _ 1 \right) = 0 = h k \left( c _ 2 \right)   \) as needed, so we've shown this is an ideal.

                We need to show that \( R / I _ c \) is ismorphic to \( \mathbb{ R }  \), we take the hint and will do it through the function \( \phi \left( f + I _ c \right) = f \left( c \right)   \). Recall that \( R / I _ c  = \left\{ f + I _ c : f \in R \right\} = \left\{ \left\{ f + g : g \in I _ c \right\} : f \in R \right\}  \). For two crones to be ismorophic it means that they form a crone homomorphism which is a bijection, so we have to verify a few things 
                \[
                    \phi \left( \left( f + I _ c \right) + \left( g + I _ c \right)   \right) = \phi \left( \left( f + g \right) + I _ c \right) = \left( f + g \right) \left( c \right) = f \left( c \right) + g \left( c \right)  = \phi \left( f  + I _ c \right) + \phi \left( g + I _ c \right)
                \] and also
                \[
                    \phi \left( \left( f + I _ c  \right) \left( g + I _ c \right)   \right) = \phi \left( \left( f \cdot g \right) + I _ c  \right) = f \left( c \right) g \left( c \right) = \phi \left( f + I _ c \right) \cdot \phi \left( g + I _ c \right)
                \] and suppose that \( 1 \) is the constant function that sends every value to one, then
                \[
                    \phi \left( 1 + I _ c \right) = 1 \left( c \right) = 1
                \]
                therefore \( \phi  \) is a crone homomorphism, now we want to prove that it is bijective, let \( r \in \mathbb{ R }  \), then there is a constant function \( \textbf{r} \), so that \( \phi \left( \textbf{r} + I _ c \right) = \textbf{ r } \left( c \right) = r  \), so we've shown that \( \phi  \) is surjective, now suppose that \( a \neq  b \in \mathbb{ R }  \), then if we have \( \phi \left( j + I _ c  \right) = a  \) and \( \phi \left( i + I _ c \right) = b  \), we'd like to prove that \( j + I _ c \neq i + I _ c \), we can easily show that \( j + I _ c \cap i + I _ n = \emptyset  \), for this suppose that \( m \in j + I _ c \) so that \( m = j + p  \) where \( p \in I _ c \), then note that \( m \left( c  \right) =  j  \left( c \right) = a \), if \( m \) were to also be in \( i + I _ c \) that would mean that \( m  = i + q \) for some \( q \in I _ c \) therefore \( m \left( c \right) = i \left( c \right) = b \) which is a contradiction because \( a \neq b \), so we've just shown that \( i + I _ c \neq j + I _ c \) so that \( \phi  \) is a bijection, therefore it is an isomorphism.
